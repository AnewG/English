主语:

```

一般情况：主语(subject, S) + 动词(verb, V)

====================

祈使句：主语省略，句首为原形动词。 
Example: 
    Work hard => (You should) work hard
祈使句变成否定形态时，要在原形动词前加 Don't。 
Example: 
    Don't be silly, Don't fool around
    
====================

感叹句：
    1.What + n + 宾表补 + 主语 + 动词...
    Example:
        What a great man he is!
    2.How + adj / How + adv + (a/an 单数名词 | 数量形容词 复数或不可数名词) + 主语 + 动词...
    Example:
        How great he is!
        How great a man he is!
        How few friends he has!

====================

动词绝不可直接当主语，一定要变成动名词或不定式短语，如此才可视为名词的对等语，作主语用。
wrong: 
    See him makes me angry (See为动词)
correct: 
    Seeing him makes me angry (Seeing为动名词，动名词作主语一般表示已知的事实或曾经的经历)
    To see him is my purpose of coming here (To see为不定式，不定式作主语一般表示意愿或未完成的事)
不定式或动名词作主语时，往往主语太长。通常用代词 it 作形式主语，置于句首。真正主语移动至句尾，通常统一改为不定式。
Example:
    Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies => It is one of his hobbies to collect stamps.
下列情况是例外(要用动名词短语，不可用不定式)：
    It is [no use] + 动名词短语。还包括 no sense, no point
    
====================

一般句子不可作主语，可转为对应从句，如名词性从句。转化后可作主语，宾语或be动词之后的表语。
wrong:
    He doesn't study makes me angry.
correct:
    That he doesn't study makes me angry.
    
that从句 whether从句 疑问词引导从句
      \     |      /
   ____名词性从句包括______
  /       |     |        \
宾语从句 主语从句 表语从句 同位语从句

转换方式：
a. that从句：句首冠以that。
b. whether从句：由一般疑问句(用yes/no回答)变化而成。
   Example:
       Is he happy? => whether he is happy | 问句有be动词，主语与be动词还原，前加 whether
       问句有一般助动词(can, will, may...)，同上
       Did he come? => whether he came     | do,does,did助动词，主语与助动词还原，再将助动词去掉。动词根据人称时态改变。
c.疑问词从句：（when, why, what 等疑问词）
   Example:
       What is he doing? => what he is doing | 保留疑问词，主语与be动词还原
       问句有一般助动词(can, will, may...)，同上
       What did he write? => what he wrote   | do,does,did助动词，主语与助动词还原，再将助动词去掉。动词根据人称时态改变。
       who, what, which 为疑问代词，可作主语。非上述情况，变为名词性从句时，结构不变。
       
使用方式：
a.名词性从句作主语。一样可后置，用it代替。
   Example:
       [Where he lives] is still in doubt.
b.作及物动词的宾语。及物动词,transitive verb(vt)。宾语,object(o)。
   Example:
       I | wonder | whether he has finished the work
c.作介词的宾语。介词,preposition(p)。
   Example:
       wrong:   I am sure [of] that ...                             | 一般来说 that 从句不可作介词的宾语。
       correct: I am sure [of] [the fact] that ...                  | 用 the fact 作介词的宾语，that 从句成为 the fact 同位语。
       
       wrong:   I am worried [about] that he plays around all day   | 错误
       correct: I am worried [about] [his] [playing] around all day | 去除 that, that 后主语变成所有格，动词变动名词。若有助动词 do,does,did,will,would 去掉即可。doesn't => not
       
       wrong:   I am happy [about] that he [may] come
       correct: I am happy [about] his [being likely to] come       | may -> be likely to, can -> be able to
       
       wrong:   I am [worried] [about] that he plays around all day
       correct: I am [worried] that he plays around all day         | be + adj + that, 去掉介词，that从句在之后作为宾语从句。
   惯用词是例外，in that, except that, dispite the fact that... 

====================

名词短语(疑问词 + 不定式短语)也可作主语

where to live
what to do
which to buy

[Where to meet him] is not decided yet.

表距离的地点副词短语也可作主语

[From Shanghai to Beijing] is about 1000 kilometers.
```

动词：

```
动词分类：complete, incomplete。有些动词可同时属于不同分类。
  c.vi 完全不及物动词, 不加宾语也完整。其后可接副词 (adverb, adv) 或副词对等语 (介词短语, 状语从句) 修饰
       Something happened [yesterday]
       He died [in an accident] - 介词短语
       He left [because he didn't want to see Mary again] - 状语从句
  i.vi 不完全不及物动词。需要用表语( subjective complement, s.c ) 补充完整意思
       He looks [happy]
       He became [a good student]
       My trouble is [that I have no money]
       He is [in danger now]  - is 为 be 动词
  c.vt 完全及物动词，加宾语（可用名词,代词,名词性从句等等）才完整
       He [stopped] (what he was doing) to talk to me when he saw me.
       名词性从句若是that, 可省略。
  i.vt 不完全及物动词，加宾语还不够，要加补语 (complement)
       He made a kite (完全vt)
       He [made] Mary [happy] (不完全vt)
       He [let] me [in] in为介副词
       I [think] that it is interesting to climb mountains (完全vt)
       I think [it] fun [to climb mountains] (不完全vt, 形式宾语it, 真正宾语后置)
       wrong: I think to climb mountains fun
       turn xx into / change xx into
  d.v  授予动词 dative verb，属于及物动词，但是接2个宾语。
       第一个间接宾语(indirect object, i.o.)表授予的对象，第二个直接宾语(direct object, d.o.)表授予的东西。
       若倒置，需加介词。
       I gave him the book. => I gave the book to him.
  
部分不及物动词可变为及物动词，以同系名词作其宾语。
  dream a terrible dream
  
出现的相关时态：

  a.主语 + 完全不及物动词
    主语 + 不完全不及物动词 + 表语
    主语 + 不完全及物动词 + 宾语 + 宾语补语
    主语 + 完全及物动词 + 宾语
    主语 + 授予动词 + 间接宾语(授予对象) + 直接宾语(被授予的东西)
    Example:
      He [wrote] a book     - vt
      Something [happened]  - vi
      
  b.主语 + be动词 + 动词现在分词 + [宾语/表语]
  Example:
      He was writing a book
      Something was happening
      主要表示某动作正在进行，也有的表示形容词。The girl is [charming]
  
  c.主语 + be动词 + 过去分词（past participle, pp）
  Example:
      The book was written by him  - vt
      主要表示被动的概念，也有的表示形容词。The man is [tired]
      
  d.主语 + be动词 + being + 过去分词
  Example:
      A book was being written by him  - vt
      主要表示正在进行的被动状态
      
  e.seem 后用不定式短语做表语，若是 to be，可省略。
  Example:
      wrong: He seems knowing it
      correct: He seems to know it
      
  f.感官动词(look,sound,smell...)后用形容词做表语。若要接名词，需加 like 等介词。也可当完全及物动词，用名词作宾语
  Example:
      wrong: It sounds [a good idea]
      correct: It sounds like a good idea
  feel like + 动名词 = would like 想要
  
  Example:
      Don't taste [that food]
  look 之后若有介词，则是短语动词，用副词修饰，而不是形容词
      He [looked into] the case [carefully]
      He [looked] happily [at] me
```

句式：

```

一般疑问句（不以What,When...为首，可用Yes/No回答）
    a. be动词，与主语倒置。
        Example: He is nice => Is he nice?
    b. 助动词(can,may...)，同上
        Example: They can handle the problem => Can they handle the problem?
    c. 其它情况，按动词时态及主语人称在句首加 Do,Does,Did..，动词改为原型。
        Example: He left early. => Did he leave early?
    肯定形态起首，认同问句用Yes问答。问句以否定形态起首，不认同问句用Yes回答。

特殊疑问句
    what,when,how... ＋ 一般疑问句倒置原则
    what,who,which三者有名词性质，可作主语。可省略主语无需倒置
    Example:
        Who came? What happened?

====================

句间连接词：
both...and...          => 一方面...同时也...（接复数动词）
either...or...         => 要不就是...要不就是...
neither...nor...       => 既非...也非...
not...but...           => 并非...而是...
not only (倒装) ... but also... => 不但...而且... also 可省略。连接句子时 but also 分开
not only...but...as well  同上
ont merely...but also
not just...but also
as well as...          => 以及...（动词随第一个主语变化）
rather than...         => 而非...（动词随第一个主语变化）
其余的动词随最近的主语做单复数变化

If
Once
As soon as + 一般现在时(或现在完成时)动词，主语 + will + 动词原型
Unless
When
Example:
    When I will be rich,I will buy a car (wrong)
    When I am rich, I will buy a car     (correct)

====================

关系代词，有连词功能，引导定语从句 (who,whom. which)。
关系代词在从句中作主语，或动词的宾语。若都不满足，则在其前加介词，或将介词移至句尾。
Example:
He is a man [who] always means what he says => 代替 a man
He is a boy [whom] everyone loves => whom[宾格]作loves的宾语
That's the book [which] I like
He is a man [for] [whom] I enjoy working
The house [in] [which] we live is very large
The house [which] we live [in] is very large
xxxxxxx, which somewhat surprised me. => which 代替整个句子时,加逗号

非限制性定语从句：
    含有专有,修饰性或独一性名词的主语 , 关系代词 + 定语从句(此时为非限制性定语从句)
    Example:
        That's [my only son], who is attending college now. 
    不可简化为分词短语
限制性定语从句：
    未具特殊性...... 先译定语从句，再译主语
    Example:
        He is a boy [who] works hard. => 他是位很用功的男孩
    简化分词短语：
        The girl [who] danced here yesterday is my sister
        The girl [dancing] here yesterday is my sister
        
that也可做关系代词，前不可加介词。
以下情况只能用that当作关系代词
a. the [first|second..last] ... that
b. the [best|most] ... that
c. all 之后
d. the only ... that
e. 2个关系代词
f. 多个性质不同名词共用一个关系代词

====================

关系副词：
where
    = in which,on which,at which 地点in,on,at
when
    = in which,on which,at which 时间in,on,at
why
    = for which
how
    = in which
    
====================

复合关系代词
    whoever:
        Whoever makes such a mistake should be punished = [Anybody] [who makes such a mistake] should be punished
    whomever(宾语):
        Give it to whomever you like = Give it to [anybody] [whom you like]
        
====================

准关系代词
than,as,but
Example:
    He is a better student [than] you are
    I don't like such a man [as] tells lies
    
====================

在一个英语简单句中，有且仅有一个动词，所以在一个句子里不得不使用两个动词时，你能做的，就是把其中的某一个动词确定为谓语动词，而把另一个动词变为动词的非谓语形式，也叫非谓语动词。

非谓语动词（可作名词，形容词，副词等）：
    1.不定式
    2.分词，现在分词 studying，过去分词 studied
        Example: 
            He is studying
    3.动名词
    
====================

下列句型中，be动词之后的to可省略，改接原型动词作表语
    Example:
        [All you have to do] is (to) [take a good rest]
        
====================

that从句简化为不定式：
    1.单一动词：
        [It] [seems] that he works hard = He [seems] to work hard
    2.be + 过去分词
        It is (said|reported|rumored) that he is good = He is (said|reported|rumored) to be good
    3.时态不同
        It [seems] that he [worked] hard = He seems to [have worked] hard
====================

I [would have] done(过去分词) it,but I was busy. = I [intended/expected... to] have done(过去分词) it,...
I [would have] done(过去分词) it,but I was busy. = I [had intended/expected... to] do(动词原型) it,...
I［was to have] done it,but .... = I [should have] done it,but ....

```

分词

```

分词就是具有动词及形容词二者特征的词

现在分词: doing
         完成时: having done
         被动式: being done
         完成进行时: having been doing
         完成被动式: having been done

过去分词: done

1.分词作形容词用
  Example:
    The student raised a [confusing] question  表主动

2.分词作表语用
  Example:
    The teacher was [confused]  表被动
    I found him [trembling]   不及物动词用现在分词形式
    
3.分词可作名词用
4.分词可作副词用
    Example: It's [freezing] cold today
    
5.两个动词同时发生，第二个为现在分词。是 be 动词，则变 being 之后再省略
    He came home [crying]
    He sat in the corner [reading] a newspaper
    He came home [was] tired => He came home [being] tired => He came home tired

6.若两个后先后次序发生，第二个为 "to + 动词原型"
    He came here [saw] me => He came here [to see me]

7.两个动词有逗号间隔，且无连接时，第二个一定是现在分词
    He ran away quickly, looking as if something terrible had happened
    
8.表身体组织的名词可变为过去分词当形容词用
    I love the [big-eyed] girl

9.某些独立分词短语具有副词功能，通常置于句首，修饰整个句子.
    [Generally speaking], men are physically stronger than women

```

动名词

```

形态跟现在分词一样

可作主语：

[Working] with him is fun

若是及物动词后的宾语为复数形式，该动名词短语仍然视为单数

[Helping others] (gives) me great pleasure

或者

[It](形式主语) gives me great pleasure to [help others](真正主语)

可作be动词后的表语:

Seeing is believing

His hobby is collecting stamps

可作动词的宾语:

He detests gambling

可作介词的宾语：

He is fond [of] [taking] a walk

可与名词连用，形成复合名词

a sleeping car 卧铺
a dining room 饭厅

常用的动名词惯用语：

There is no V-ing ... = It is impossible to V

It is no use V-ing ... = It is of no use to V

cannot (help|stop|resist|refraim from) V-ing

on V-ing ... = 一...就...

```

助动词

```

加强说明动词

I [must] go at once

1.be 动词作助动词的情况

He [is] reading(现在分词) a book     进行时
He [was] elected(过去分词) chairman  被动语态

2.have,has,had + 过去分词            已经...

3.do,does,did + not + 动词原型, 任何东西与not连用作否定时，一定要这类助动词。但不与 not 以外的否定副词连用

I [didn't know] what to do
[Did] you [understand] it ?
He [did] work hard , [Do] be quiet  表强调

4.代动词(pro-verb),代替动词 

Did you read this book? -> Yes, I did (= read this book)

5.shall, will

6.should = ought to

should have + 过去分词

1.与事实相反的虚拟语气(早应...): If you had not helped me, I [should have died]
2.居然已经,应当已经: It is surprising that he [should have passed] the examiniation

7.would  will的过去式

He [said](一般过去时) that he [will visit](一般将来时) the country sometime in July

If I had money now, I [would] buy a car. (But I don't have money now) 与现在事实相反
If I had had money then, I [would have] bought a car. (But I didn't have money then) 与过去事实相反

8.would rather

9.would you mind

10.can,could

11.would,could 可表客气语气
[Could] you please do it for me?

```
